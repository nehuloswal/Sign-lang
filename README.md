# Sign-lang
The basic motivation of the project is to provide hearing impaired students with an interactive mathematics textbook. In order to do this we designed and trained deep learning models for detecting sign language gesture. For the purpose of detecting static sign language we used CNN with U-Net for image segmentation and LSTM for detecting dynamic signs.
